                For the girl, it was love at first sight.  The boy didn't even seem to 
                notice.  It wasn't exactly a typical storybook romance.

                After graduation, the girl moved away.  Increased distance showed them 
                what they had been taking for granted.  Although now separated by 1200 
                miles, their relationship blossomed.

                Three years and a stack of cell phone bills later, they were finally 
                reunited for good.  They moved in together, bought some Ikea furniture, 
                and started going on adventures.  They even adopted a lion-hearted 
                kitty.
